The visionn for the end result would be
- recommend the best time to plant the crops taking into account the climate requirements and the forecast of the best time to sell the crop
- Once planted, automate the aggregation of data
  - soil information from gauges in the farm land
  - weather information from weather APIs
  - insect and disease images from drones
- With real time data, make decisions on actions to take, define specific actions for the centralling controlled farm equipment
